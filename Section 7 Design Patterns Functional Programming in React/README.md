# Functional Programming Use-cases

1. Controlled Components
2. Fucntional Components
3. HOCs
4. Recursive Components
5. Partial Components
6. Composition

Recursive Components rely on recursion to achive specific effects, they can be incredibly powerful and offer unique solutions to complex problems.

Partial Components enable the creation of more specific versions of general components by passing subset of the components props. This technique allows for code reuse and flexibility and component customization.

Composition involves combining multiple components into a single component to achieve a desired effect.
